            <p>Hi! My name is Martin Hamzai and I am a ML/AI Platform Engineer at the Internal Revenue Service. I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Computational Modeling and Data Analytics from Virginia Tech back in May 2025. I minored in Computer Science, Economics, and Mathematics.</p>
            <p>My domain interests include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Science</li>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</li>
                <li>Software Development</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I have a passion for exploring and learning stuff in many domains, so that list is not comprehensive, just my main interests and work.</p>
